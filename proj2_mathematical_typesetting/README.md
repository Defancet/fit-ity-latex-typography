## Project Description

This LaTeX project focuses on structuring documents and typesetting mathematical formulas. It demonstrates the use of
advanced LaTeX features to manage document layouts and complex mathematical expressions efficiently.

## Features

- **Document Structuring**: Utilizes multiple LaTeX packages to manage document layout including custom title pages and
  two-column formatting.
- **Mathematical Typesetting**: Implements `amsmath`, `amsfonts`, and `amssymb` for enhanced mathematical expression
  handling, including definitions, theorems, and multiple mathematical operations.
- **Advanced Formatting**: Employs detailed formatting techniques like precise vertical spacing, font size adjustments,
  and hyperlink management.
