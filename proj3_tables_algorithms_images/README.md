## Project Description

This project involves creating a LaTeX document that includes typesetting for tables, algorithms, and images. The goal
is to closely replicate a provided sample document, focusing on accurate representation of tables, well-formatted
algorithms, and both vector and bitmap images.

## Features

- **Tables**: Utilizes LaTeX environments like `tabbing` and `tabular` to create detailed and formatted tables.
- **Algorithms**: Incorporates the `algorithm2e` package to format complex algorithms with custom styling and numbering.
- **Images**: Demonstrates the inclusion of both bitmap and vector images, ensuring correct scaling and positioning
  within the document.
